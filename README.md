# Spin Menu Widget

## Introduction

This script provides a PyQt5-based custom widget called `ArcWidget`, which creates a circular spin menu. The menu consists of sectors that can be clicked to trigger various actions. This README.md provides an overview of the script and instructions on how to use it.

## Requirements

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- PyQt5
- keyboard
- pyqtkeybind

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 keyboard pyqtkeybind

## Usage

Use a hotkey (e.g., "Ctrl+D") to trigger the appearance of the circular menu. Modify the hotkey as needed.
